A vibrant, stylized logo for a snake and ladder game with elemental themes. The logo features a bold, circular emblem divided into four quadrants, each representing one of the four elements: fire, water, earth, and air. In the fire quadrant, a stylized red flame curls around a golden snake; in the water quadrant, a blue wave curls around a silver ladder; in the earth quadrant, a green leaf intertwines with a bronze ladder; and in the air quadrant, a yellow gust of wind wraps around a silver snake. The background is a deep navy gradient that fades to black at the edges, giving the emblem a dramatic, mystical feel. The overall design is clean, modern, and instantly recognizable, suitable for a game logo.
